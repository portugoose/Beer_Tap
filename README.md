# Beer_Tap
This is my project to have Alexa to Operate a beer tap using Arduino MKR 1010 Wifi

This project is not complete at the time I wrote this document.
The code at this point can enable Alexa to control a light which then turns on a servo motor. I have currently a new motor on the way that I will be attaching a metal rod which will then be attached to the beer tap handle. If you look at the pictures the straw that I am holding will be what the metal rod will look like. I plan on bending the rod using heat and a vice to the correct angles.

How I connected Arduino MKR 1010 Wifi to Alexa:
You first need to have a Arduino Create Account and add a "New Thing" from here (https://create.arduino.cc/iot/things).
Follow the directions inorder to add your arduino board. When prompted for device type, scroll down to Smart Home and choose "Dimmed Light"

For the coding aspect I followed the directions from (https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/11/12/create-a-voice-controlled-device-with-alexa-and-arduino-iot-cloud-in-7-minutes/) and added code inorder to control a servo.

I will be updating this document with a parts list once I have the motor recieved and have a working proto type that I can record.

Let me know if you have any questions

Thanks!
